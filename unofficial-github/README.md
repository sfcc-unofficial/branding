Instructions

> We've created a large variety of ready made logos & icons, but before you choose which one is right for you, here are some things to consider:

- [X] Our [Logo](#logo) looks good at `48px` or higher
- [X] If you need something smaller than `48px`, you should use our [Icon](#icon)
- [X] If you're using a light color background, use our [Transparent Dark](#transparent-dark) logo
- [X] If you're using a dark color background, use our [Transparent Light](#transparent-light) logo
- [X] If you are not sure what background color the logo will end up on, use our [Transparent Medium](#transparent-medium) as they can work on dark or light backgrounds, or you can also choose to use `solid` logo that have a filled in background to avoid any possible color issues
