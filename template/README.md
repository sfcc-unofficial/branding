Unofficial Logo & Icon Template
===

This is the Source Illustrator File that contains custom layers to allow a designer to edit the text, apply textures and other fun stuff.  It is used to make all the other logos and icons.  Probably not something you need to mess with unless you are designing a new logo or icon for this project.
